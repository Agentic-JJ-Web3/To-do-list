# üìù Simple To-Do List Application

## ‚ú® Overview

This is a basic, yet functional, To-Do List application built using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a foundational project to practice and solidify core front-end development skills. The current version provides the essential functionality of adding and managing tasks.

As I continue my learning journey, this project will evolve to incorporate more advanced features, making it a comprehensive and robust task management tool.

## üöÄ Current Features

* **Add New Tasks:** Easily input and add new tasks to your list.

* **Mark as Complete:** Toggle tasks as complete or incomplete.

* **Delete Tasks:** Remove unwanted tasks from the list.

* **Responsive Design:** A clean and simple interface that works across different screen sizes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web page.

* **CSS3:** For styling and making the application visually appealing.

* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For interactive functionality and dynamic content manipulation.

## üíª How to Use/Run

To get this To-Do List application up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
   If this project is hosted on a version control system like Git, clone it to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-folder>
   
   ```

   *(If not, simply download the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files into a single folder.)*

2. **Open `index.html`:**
   Navigate to the project folder and simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file.

   That's it! The application should load directly in your browser.

## üí° Future Enhancements (Planned)

This project is a living document of my learning, and I have exciting plans for its future development:

* **Animations:** Adding subtle animations for task addition, completion, and deletion to enhance user experience.

* **Task Counter:** Displaying a count of pending and completed tasks.

* **Notifications:** Implementing browser notifications for due tasks or important reminders.

* **Local Storage/Database Integration:** Persisting tasks even after the browser is closed, using either browser's local storage or a backend database.

* **Task Filtering:** Options to filter tasks (e.g., all, active, completed).

* **Task Editing:** Ability to modify existing task descriptions.

* **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Reorder tasks by dragging and dropping them.
